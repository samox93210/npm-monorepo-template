[![Github Actions](https://github.com/jkomyno/pnpm-monorepo-example/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jkomyno/pnpm-monorepo-example/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

> Practical example of a `TypeScript` monorepo with [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io), [`turborepo`](https://turborepo.org), and [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/).

Tested with:
- **Node.js v20.17.0**
- **pnpm v9.11.0**
- **vitest v2.1.2**

## What's Included

- `pnpm` workspace, whose configuration is stored in [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](/pnpm-workspace.yaml). Two example packages are included, [`common-utils`](packages/common-utils) and [`example`](packages/example), with the latter importing `common-utils` as a dependency. All local packages are decorated with a `@jkomyno/*` scope (you may want to substitute these instances in the `name` entries of any `package.json` with yours or your company's name).
- `tsup` bundler, whose configuration is stored in [`tsup.config.ts`](./tsup.config.ts).
- `turborepo`, whose configuration is stored in [`turbo.json`](./turbo.json)
- an example [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile.pnpm) that can be built and used as a base image for your Node.js Docker containers.
- the `vitest` test engine, whose configuration is stored in [`vitest.workspace.ts`](./vitest.workspace.ts).
- opinionated linting setups via [`biome`](https://biomejs.dev/), whose configuration is defined in the [`biome.jsonc`](./biome.jsonc) file.

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm install`: install the dependencies needed for each package.
- `pnpm build`: transpile the local TypeScript packages to JavaScript.
- `pnpm build:watch`: transpile the local TypeScript packages to JavaScript, and watch for changes.
- `pnpm check:exports`: check that the `exports` field in the `package.json` files of each exported package is correctly set, using [`@arethetypeswrong/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arethetypeswrong/cli).
- `pnpm lint:ci`: check that the code follows the `biome` guidelines.
- `pnpm lint`: check that the code follows the `biome` guidelines, and override it to follow them if possible.
- `pnpm test:unit`: run unit tests.
- `pnpm test:integration`: run integration tests.
- `pnpm test`: run all tests.

## Test Structure

We follow an opinionated convention for storing an running tests.
All tests should be written in the `__tests__` directory of a local package.
Moreover, unit tests should be placed in the `__tests__/unit` folder; similarly, integration tests should be placed in the `__tests__/integration` folder.
This allows for easily running groups of tests (for instance, you might want to run unit tests locally, while deferring integration tests - that will probably need access to external services like Docker containers - to the CI only).

## FAQ

1. How do I add a new package to the local workspace?

- Create a new folder `$packageName` in [`packages/`](packages/). Initialize it with a `tsconfig.json` file (which will reference the [`tsconfig.base.node.json`](./tsconfig.base.node.json) file at the root level) and a `package.json` file similarly to how it's done in the  [`common-utils`](packages/common-utils) package.

2. How do I add a new depedency that should be available to each package in the local workspace?

> `pnpm add -w $dependencyName`
